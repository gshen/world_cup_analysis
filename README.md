Analyze world cup players data from 2006 to 2018

Original data come from FIFA in PDF format, I wrote the program to extract information in the below format:

Year, Country, Date of Birth, Height (cm), Age, Zodiac Sign, Weight (kg)

Sample rows:

2018	Tunisia	27.07.1992	173	26	Leo	65

2018	Uruguay	16.06.1986	190	32	Gemini	74

The code to extract the data is commented out in analyze_WC_data.py which can be uncommented to execute easily. All the parsed data are stored in the CSV file of World_Cup_Players_Data.csv.
